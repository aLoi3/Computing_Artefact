# Individual Final-Year 'Major' Computing Project
## COMP320/COMP360

This is the base repository for the computing artefact you are developing for your final year project.

### Information

This repository contains computing artefact. It includes free assets from Unreal marketplace, which are used to create an explorative level for both players and AI.
Everything I created for this artefact is in blueprints and will be placed under Content/Artefact/...

### Credits
